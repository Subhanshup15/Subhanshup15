✅ This version is **cleaner, more professional, and recruiter-friendly**.
✅ Keeps all your details but highlights **skills, achievements, and live links**.
✅ Adds polish with **badges, profile views, and consistent formatting**.

Do you want me to also **make a compact "resume-style" version** (shorter, very crisp for quick scanning), or keep it detailed like this?
